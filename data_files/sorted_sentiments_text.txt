-130.97740223288784: As someone who kinda enjoys Fallout 76, Bethesda deserves the backlash. At this point, it's not about the subjective "is the game fun," bullshit. Bethesda is now simply anti-consumer. Incompetence or not, they've clearly failed their audience, and they need to deal with it.

-207.76831313643652: FALLOUT 76 is a glitchathon of a game, stuttering and freezing, but still fun, addicting with its post nuke open world. A big game with hit & &amp; miss missions. Despite its flaws, I dig it.


-209.15578411059278: Ok so with Fallout 76 being the worst game ever created, i am genuinely scared for them to even make the elder scrolls 6. Anyone else feel this way?


-210.09981291000824: @ProfaneAnnalist Honestly you might be able to port the 76 map and assets back into fallout 4 and make this much better game idea a big mod.


-213.12625260463545: It‚Äôs funny tht Bethesda took 3 years to make their multiplayer mode for Fallout 4, called it a new game and charged $60 for it. Poorly made in every way.

Meanwhile Red Dead online is launching a month after Red Dead and is far and away better multiplayer mode. Also it‚Äôs free.


-213.3706398728033: Bethesda has fucked up over Fallout 76 but I'm not gonna start hating a company that has literally provided me with hundreds and hundreds of hours of entertainment for the price of a few shots per game. It's weird to me how people have turned on them. O_o


-214.24499054576677: @cirifionas i think i like quite a lot of games from bethesda the publisher but none of them was made by bethesda itself lmao


-218.5063691536539: I think Bethesda does have the funds and stuff to put in effort and yet with Fallout 76 it shows just how much they don't care with their incompetence. 

Fallout 3 released about 10 years ago and since then Bethesda has constantly reused broken codes and assets from older games.


-222.2786669350943: Y'know, usually I tend to roll my eyes at huge overreactions to bad video games but I'm signal boosting this because:

- This bag thing is actually shit. Like what the fuck.
- fuck Bethesda https://t.co/rSuQXxogOe


-233.4386883584397: I feel like #Fallout76 fell victim to the Youtube algorithm.  It became lucrative to shit on it.

It has problems, but I also feel like I've gotten my money's worth after buying it @ launch.  I've had a ton of fun playing w/ friends, and it can only go uphill from here.


-235.3400342645775: @GazDeaves It‚Äôs a shame gaz that you guys are doing a games as service thing. We were ALL hoping you‚Äôd do another single player game and not fall into the corporate greed scheme of things but ah well. Bethesda fell, now rocksteady probably will to which Is a shame.


-237.73893706334198: "But it's the norm of the game industry to reuse assets and codes"

Repeating the same mistakes over and over is the exact opposite of what you should be doing. Look, I'm ok if you agree or disagree with my argument but I want you to realize just how much Bethesda gets away with.


-238.91117970605774: @Dr_Zuo @bethesda @BethesdaSupport @Fallout It's not a perfect game but almost no game is Bethesda trying something new that they've never done before I bought the power armor Edition I don't give a care about the type of material the canvas bag is at this point everybody's just freaking out over nothing


-250.12859597557895: I'm actually horny over how much trouble Bethesda is going to get in over this fucking canvas bag thing


-251.18536212311025: In light of all the Fallout 76 nonsense, I'm going to dredge up this meme I made over a year ago. The bag thing gets a pass, but literally *everything else* was widely available info prior to the game's release. https://t.co/2G6SEK1bz0


-258.24241159584574: What Fallout 76 did on every level was false advertising. The game was not what we saw in trailers, the promised functionality did not exist, and even the freaking collectors edition bag was essentially toilet paper. 

This is a dumpster fire for the record books.


-268.4503244266336: "fallout 76"
#Fallout76

$290 for a nylon bag?

if you advertise canvas bag? then there better be a canvas bag? false advertising is a serious issue?

this is the attitude that these companies have? under-cut consumers? in-game credit on cash spent for collectors edition?fuckyou?


-272.75052066745013: So reusing engine assets from older games really isn't a big deal and games like CoD have been doing it for a decade straight

But lmao at the other two parts there https://t.co/plILp6uTaR


-281.19481270375564: Didnt fit it into todays fallout 76 story but...

The $200 collectors edition promised a nice canvas bag for your helmet.

It came with a cheap nylon bag instead. https://t.co/DfyqnDwY2e


-296.1023944689558: i feel like bethesda uses fallout to just experiment on different aspects for games. like they dont really care abt‚Ä¶ https://t.co/8gCo62hPj5


-296.3465021618175: I don't get how these two textures are from the same game, on the same computer, with the same MAX settings. The tree almost looks real and the tank looks like it's mesh & &amp; texture caught a computer virus. #Fallout76 https://t.co/s6glaIcBmL


-301.2209314649407: @vayne804 @Wear_Condoms @ichigosinful @BasaraMario @Blake_Hendren @Fallout Sorry I was so harsh on you. I thought you were trying to excuse the things that are clearly wrong with the game. I am fed up with people blindly defending the game because it is bethesda and fallout.


-315.1641831670059: For anyone thinking they're living in an alternate dimension and confused why Bethesda is now saying the bag was always Nylon, this is from launch. They never said it was going to be Nylon from the start or even warned that it wasn't represenative of the final product. https://t.co/EyhbivXgCU


-315.45922080875243: Promo images lie. Fraud Coward, 76 is an asset flip, etc. But this could be a class action lawsuit. Your answer is to bait the victims into buying more microtransaction credits by giving them a tiny amount of a fake currency in compensation. May as well have been spider rings. https://t.co/0Cx4rWYbQ6


-367.17098032293984: Bethesda, sued to the brink of bankruptcy over Fallout 76, fire Todd Howard.

Jobless, his family abandons him. Cold and alone, he wanders the streets for days before passing out in a dark alley.

He awakens to the sound of a carriage creaking.

"Hey, you. You're finally awake." https://t.co/BEbumUkWtV


-430.2279728322457: My experience with Fallout 76:
Truly abysmal, I feel embarrassed for paying money for it. Runs like trash on pc, looks like garbage, 2D art linework is really amateur for some reason, feels unfinished and incomplete, gameplay and AI are clunky and underdeveloped. Do not buy. https://t.co/k3XTqM1wrQ
