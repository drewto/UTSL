-321.38511013961755: @CampagnaTeam @historicralph @Comey Clearly this has been going on way before Trump was the POUS because he was investigating Hillary and lied to Congress.

-330.2130502570313: So much of American journalism since the rise of the tea party and especially Trump has been hobbled by lack of familiarity with the idea of the petit bourgeoisie https://t.co/yjuNKDHphh


-330.2749321827849: 10) What about judges? While the DS is focused on pushing the Russia collusion and shutting Trump down at every turn, the senate has been confirming judges at a steady rate for months and months. So it seems we have that under control.


-330.4612264746645: Caravan Migrants Back Down From Storming Border – Say They Were Lied To By “Leaders."  "Obama is no longer President – there’s a new sheriff in town – President Trump is fighting like hell to keep these caravans from entering the US.”  #SendThemHome https://t.co/f9w6pr6DeI


-330.532266475526: President Trump told reporters on the way back to the US from Buenos Aires he will terminate the NAFTA agreement and give Congress the choice between his new USMCA agreement or no agreement.

They will choose NO agreement, I'm sure, to spite Trump. https://t.co/Fr0ANdXBvP


-330.9214889253341: Absolutely brilliant news - a new @springsteen tour. Will attempt as many shows as we can - you up for it @thegoalzone


-331.01677085274025: 2/ The story makes it clear that it was some underlings pursuing "deals" in which Trump was largely uninvolved, other than to put his name to the building. If anything, it shows how Trump is not a real-estate "developer" as he claims, but just a "namer".


-331.3720758112688: I didn't agree with Bush's politics but I never felt that he was in it just for himself. If Bush is a yardstick is Trump even measurable? RIP Mr President


-331.6353483092495: @_Bromeo That article was a waste of paper. If Trump is being racist to make himself a consumable product and you are happily consuming it?  Circular logic always reminds me of a snake eating its tail.


-332.2998869499278: @SallyAlbright .. oh, and the United States needs to cast away the most dishonorable, immoral, mafia, president, ever .. TRUMP


-332.54286653845827: There's a reason why Trump kills 2 regulations for every new 1; he doesn't just kill all regulations. Because conservatives are for small government, not zero government. This is a federation, not a confederation.

-332.79584572771716: God bless the people of France! We understand why Pres. Trump isn't standing with Macron or Merkle, they dont have the welfare of their people as a priority. They're globalists with socialistic dreams of a NWO where they're in charge. Macron should of listened to President Trump! https://t.co/8Ph0UajXeY


-333.07087934124405: Says the idiot Socialist who’s made millions in the Capitalist system he despises because of businessmen like @realDonaldTrump. Hey,Bruce. Go and try pulling that off in Venezuela or one of your other socialist paradise’s. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder https://t.co/auSnh0zaul


-333.4634900125718: @DiamondandSilk The same Liberal Media now screaming about President Trump praised Obama when he did the same thing many times, saying he was protecting our country. Once again the Liberal "Fake News" Media is showing the world just how big hypocrites they are. https://t.co/pojOHvbZGk

-333.94030642780956: @Delavegalaw Amen ! Been saying TT Moscow was ‘chump change’ at a time when Trump felt he had the world by the tail and it was time to go ‘elephant hunting.’ We’ll discover massive corrupt business deals, in Russia, Middle East, China and elsewhere. Tip of the iceberg.


-333.9870343153499: @johnpmoreau @RyanAFournier The double standard is blatant asswipe. Infringing on conservative’s rights is what created Trump.Every time someone else is silenced the louder the group becomes.


-334.1498827284836: Just a thought but I think the US Intelligence, Military, et cetera should immediately stop giving Trump any more confidential info. He’ll surely try to fuck us over once he flees to Russia following his inevitable fall. #dems

-335.03199395891943: I wrote this almost exactly a year ago, and I stand by it. 

It's no coincidence that, as we approach endgame for Trump, we're starting to hear Pence's name mentioned—and not just because he's next in line for the presidency.

-335.1163066041145: At the same time candidate Trump publicly urged sanctions relief for Russia, he was privately putting together a business deal in Moscow that required lifting US sanctions. Then President Trump and his confederates misled the country about it, in a way that left him compromised. https://t.co/4qNg86FHGa


-335.1248263420347: I wish people would stop treating this as a conscious strategic choice. Like Trump himself, the GOP as become pure creature of myopic tribal resentments. It is what it is; it could not choose to be otherwise. https://t.co/ZrVYumlx0M


-335.18041109690813: @StormResist @MrScottLads @axidentaliberal @ifindkarma @jomareewade @Augustus709 @HMAesq @EmmaFrostResist @jacksnowknows @SusanBChurch11 @TrisResists @TrinityResists This is absolutely on the Republican party.

Tell legislators to support The Mashpee Reservation Reaffirmation Act.


-335.33413797460184: In Michael Cohen's court filing it says that Trump's legal team created all of the false statements he made to Congress and he was ordered to use them by Trump.


-335.3832273433166: Buckle up. If Trump is ever going to try and fire Mueller it will happen this week.


-335.45656863804436: @DrKlep Something like 9% of actual Republicans voted for Trump in the primaries. It’s frustrating I wish they’d rigged their primary like the Dems did


-335.6039666662982: @Mrs_Malindo @flyboy_1776 @ChuckGrassley @GenFlynn @GenFlynn was charged to send a message to anyone else that supported President Trump @POTUS  The message was and is, "We intend to destroy not only Donald Trump but anyone who supports, endorses or works for Donald Trump.."  The Deep State is a bottomless pit of corruption.


-336.0896535873172: I’ll believe that Trump is growing into the presidency when his staff stops talking about him like a toddler. https://t.co/RWKWx5z2Be https://t.co/lVB2qhACYK

-337.8672439764019: @PattyMurray Patty Murray, so pleased you are on the case of the Trump administration’s viral attack of the Affordable Care Act, (ACA). These sleazy insurers are hauling in billions by under serving an unsuspecting boomer generation.


-338.5963872292357: President Trump @realDonaldTrump not lie. It's so ugly to lie. US are in the Middle East because of arms companies, oil companies, American banks, heroin business ... and logically also to protect your beloved ally Israel apartheid/terrorist regime

-338.69043934783093: Cooperator Cohen is the only Trump aide who after pleading guilty is EARNESTLY cooperating w/ Mueller and revealing the truth about Trump’s dealings with Russia WHILE Russia was attacking our election. We need @MichaelCohen212 to continue cooperating & &amp; @MichaelAvenatti to zip it. https://t.co/OpVPgZ08Dy


-338.81072645033004: In Wisconsin, right now, the GOP has total control: the governorship, both chambers of the state legislature, and a majority on the Supreme Court. That's one big reason why Trump won WI in 2016—because they'd rigged the rules. Now they want to prevent Dems from unrigging them.


-338.9953316018833: @CharlesKStanley @tribelaw @maddow Mueller has had the evidence for the Trump Tower Moscow deal for months; some intelligence analysts independently have written about the Trump Tower Moscow deal as long ago as 2016.


-339.0285288957967: Congrats Mueller.  You successfully proved that Cohen lied about a LEGAL BUSINESS DEAL that never took place, and wouldn’t have been illegal or a crime if it had.

-341.2062027492984: Translation (c/o Trump's *OWN* D/CIA and now SECSTATE): Wikileaks = GRU.

GRU is Putin's rancid, murderous MI service.

If you collaborated with WikiLeaks in 2016 to get HRC/DRC's stolen emails, you were working with GRU.

That simple, folks.


-341.3540781930659: @jmichaelkell @sherrilee7 The media played a huge role. They were cowed by the “Fake News” invented by Trump to manipulate the masses—and were as manipulated as MAGAts.

-341.3840952359813: @greed_cap Everything should move. But not so sure on EU as 1) Trump always keeping pressure on somewhere will turn to cars / EU now 2) remaining swans are in that geographic area (Brexit and Italian EDP/risk Lega calls early elections) so would rather play elsewhere..

-341.97579792117415: Call it what you want, but do send the perpetrator back to prison, lock him up and throw the key away! Hate & &amp; violence have increased in past years. Donald Trump's words and actions sure do not help.


-342.04062103846877: President Trump helped US Senate candidate John James.
Where were you, Mia?
Perhaps you were embracing racial neutrality? 

Folks, IMHO, it’s time to temper racial neutrality.

-343.5607979556686: @clarencesilkwow @TwistedinGa @TonyLavelleJr @marklutchman @peden_c America is in debt because of wasteful spending by the Republicans.

Hard to commend trump for record low employment and creating jobs then, reject People from other Countries willing to come here and work. 5,000 People sitting at the border, I'm willing to bet most want to work!


-343.73129907571774: Trump was put in this place he’s in for a reason.  He didn’t have to he was asked to by very prominent people and Military.  It’s obvious


-343.7536616814336: THIS. When you wonder where stolen children seeking safe refuge end up after they are taken to 'shower', just think of Donald @realDonaldTrump and his history of CHILD sex trafficking. He's a filthy, disgusting mofo.

-343.9007218926879: @DogWalkingDame @YouTube That’s great. Also Trump reached trade deals with Canada, Mexico, and China all in one week. I think the Mexican government has to cooperate on immigration as part of that deal. It’s the art of the deal baby!


-343.9544497643998: @tribelaw @RepAdamSchiff Which is why Trump attacked him.
Trump's tweets are as telling as chocolate on the face of a toddler who adamantly claims he didn't steal the cookie.


-343.9708084245989: Sorry but the woman who facilitated massive weapons deals for Saudi Arabia, and took millions of dollars from this barbaric regime even after admitting that Riyadh was the world’s top funder of terrorism, should just sit this one out.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s office issued a statement calling for investigation into Trump's Acosta and Epstein!
https://t.co/hTlknVN9Iz
Does Acosta have the dirt? Part of the plan? If POTUS is truly insulated, this brings that little island into evidence.


-457.2251856336419: @Trump454545 @BarackObama ignored the facts that the 4 American's could have been saved! It's to bad he won't take responsibility for this or the spying on Trump prior to the election while he was still President of the USA! It's an embarrassment to the our Nation! 🇺🇸🇺🇸

-457.95692419568445: @Kris_Sacrebleu Let's see it happen. Another great thing about Trump is how he's functionally lifting the depravity of these people to the surface in a way that is now newly credible. Two years ago, this was overlooked - now people are looking at it with new eyes and believing it.

-458.27851287790384: @BetteMidler Some rich folks who cared not whether factories return to the US, some who refused to work and cared not whether taxes are cut, and everyone who benefits from policies that drain the patriots’ resources - these people hate Trump.


-458.33269889606606: @MeetThePress @chucktodd @SenJohnBarrasso Funny, I think @SenJohnBarrasso would have a different opinion if this was being done by ANY democrat.

-458.91254359738474: @SweetAcrimony @Kasparov63 I think #Trump has been consumed by a minuscule % of social media trolls and forgot the country and people that he is trying to help.  Sadly it exemplifies a very weak minded, unconfident person. Clearly not the attributes of a @POTUS


-459.0455229651144: What an awful excuse for a human being trump is. This is no way to run the USA, a once compassionate nation, that’s for certain. He and his VP and cabinet should be ousted as soon as possible. They’re destroying everything good in this country. https://t.co/Vbpg9uyzUi

-461.60642932765523: @InvestStratWire The more cynical side of me, and when it comes to Trump all I have, is that he's using the stock markets as one giant backhander. The perfect way to pay who he needs to by engineering incoherent market moves. Payoffs hiding in plain sight.

-471.34311087458497: The absolute biggest bs line perpetrated by the Right and falsely repeated by aspiring #Trump supporters legal scholars is this idea of a “perjury trap”. Repeat after me: It’s not a perjury trap if you tell the truth.

-485.1500208409253: @robreiner It’s just a matter of time for newly elected officials to take their seat not only in the House, but the NY state legislation so that any federal charges Trump thinks they can pardon out of will hit a wall of state charges in NY for his entire family.


-485.46219019675425: My get-rich-quick scheme:

3. Profit

The human cost of kleptocracy.


-487.6514335407753: It seems Mueller delayed Cohen's admission of guilt until after Trump had submitted his written answers to Mueller. Mueller surely asked Trump about the Moscow project. Trump's answers were likely locked in before he could factor in Cohen's admissions. https://t.co/TDgsHthidE

BUT, Trump has also brought some previous non-voters into the Republican Party.

Who has Trump recruited into the Republican Party?


-501.54134683571647: Fox hit piece on GOP.  Claims Trump is exclusionary to race and gender. Also claims he has no message. Complete trash. Trump is fighting daily for the avg American. Stop illegal immigration is a msg. So is America 1st. Really starting to hate Fox.

-502.0908446091461: By all means, the situation at the border is chaos, and damaging to international human rights.  It's been messed up for a while, and Trump just made it 100X worse.  I still think it's important to stick to facts, and stay committed to truth.

-550.571458102052: @NancySinatra Putin's guy is Manafort. He got greedy & &amp; ripped off some oligarch types. Putin used it and Manafort was installed, fast. He only needed to use Trump's ego to get him to run for president. The family's greed would make it a snap.


-550.6252476150282: .@realDonaldTrump appeared in a Bobby Brown video in '89. It shows him looking up at an image of Bobby, a black man, on Trump Tower. A so-called racist would never agree to such a thing. Trump isn't racist and he doesn't care about race. He cares about character. #VoteRed #BLEXIT https://t.co/oyz6vRVqvJ


-550.6307958697663: Even though Trump loves to quote the legal opinions of Dershowitz, despite his lack of integrity and illegal perverted proclivities (see @fabiolasantiago), there’s no such thing as a perjury trap.

-554.6132086753116: @John200MA @Shdwsnlite @CNN @JohnAvlon @realDonaldTrump What's actually happening is that individual states are deciding to keep to the terms of the agreement on their own, and the rest of the world has woken up to the fact that they don't need to look to America for leadership.

And there's not a damn thing Trump can do about it.


-555.2045150445998: The same EU leaders who called Trump a fascist will on Dec 12 sign the UN Migration Pact, which will make it easy for them to end free speech in their nations, as actual fascists always do as soon as they have the means to do it.


-556.8212833670898: @gregolear @pldLMT You make an excellent case. I agree that puppet pence should NEVER be potus, under any circumstance. The entire trump administration is rife with corruption and criminals, and they should all go.


-557.6983989421002: @justinjm1 @saletan I see 3 lanes: 1) Russian conspiracy w/the Trump Campaign data team & &amp; Cambridge Analytica to use psychometrics to influence voter turn-out. 2) Russian collusion w/Trump Campaign & &amp; Wikileaks to release hacked DNC emails when needed. 3) Trump obstructing justice & &amp; abuse of power.

There's so many bigger things to protest than what you're doing. The US was almost handed over to the EU and the only reason it wasn't is because Trump won!


-559.8776264197561: Hahaha!

-565.8007827202687: @butchcjg That's not what Trump is doing though. Nothing he does has to do with transparency or good government; it's greed, power, and dodging prison.

-584.581219577014: @brycetache My parents would shoot me if I marched on Xmas. If Trump fires Mueller there won't have to be any marching. It's the clearest evidence of obstruction yet (and that's saying something). Even right wing Congress people can't ignore it. Mueller will be OK.


-585.1029555334806: @JMyers1971 @JuliaDavisNews If you've been following her, you know there's never been any respect and nothing but but derision throughout Russia towards Trump.

-586.6038924510509: A condition also known as #TheMueller. A powerful force field that swallows up every last fiber of one's brain matter (or the only fiber in some, AKA #tRump) whereas one is unable to function with basic routine actions. #MuellerIsInHisHead #goingdown #LostAtG20


-586.6629986178442: Lying to law enforcement in exchange for a pardon. This seems to be a pattern by the Trump campaign to interfere with any investigation.

No wonder Trump brought on Rudy Giuliani because the criminal activity implicates criminal liability under RICO. https://t.co/1uTqMK5QTV


-586.9919652292904: @MSNBC It isn't a mistake, he didn't get it wrong,  he didn't get bad information, he didn't misspeak.  He intentionally LIED, Trump is a LIAR, he compulsively LIES, he LIES about his LIES.  He LIES when he doesn't have to LIE,  he is a LIAR. Get it right for once.


-587.7257447369409: 22/ But it's for *legal* reasons that the Trump-Agalarov deal is far *more* dangerous to Trump than the Trump-Rozov deal, which is why it's wildly to the benefit of the administration that so far—for no evident reason—the media has ignored the Trump-Agalarov deal almost entirely.


-588.5511752014971: Are you telling us that the President of the United States is violating the law by refusing to give veterans the benefits to which they are entitled by law?

That sounds like an impeachable offense to me.

But I don't believe you for a second.

You are a shameful demagogue. https://t.co/o8tgCYRfF7


-588.6863283758855: I'm glad that conservatives such as Lewandowski, Bongino, et al, have written books about Trump to set the record straight and give history an accurate account of the truth. I plan on being an old man 1 day and don't want to be hearing in the year 2060 that orange man was bad.


-588.8513534346728: @ForecasterEnten Names I wish would just stand down: Sanders, Gillibrand, Biden, Warren, (Avenatti, if he isn't already standing down).

I like Warren, but she wouldn't beat Trump. 

Abrams and O'Rourke are inspiring, and in their own ways, could put him in his place.

-591.5193405299048: @Johndzergoski2 @mitchellvii @rkukkapalli1 Mueller has much backing for this to just keep going w/o “getting” the target, Trump. I believe it’s being used to inflict pain, divide & &amp; cause T’s base to lose heart. It’s political war fare. His rallies prove so far it’s not worked.


-591.6960887347004: Not-so-hypothetical question: when a mob boss says he hires only the “best people,” wouldn’t that actually mean he hires only the “worst people,” at least to those of us who do not share his criminal values? This is how we should interpret Trump’s inverted moral rhetoric. #Dems

He left Exxon to join trump administration where he tried to lift sanctions.

-594.6716163839388: Think how many Republicans are now wondering why they went all in with Trump. When he finally goes down, when the mountain of lies & &amp; crimes makes his exit unavoidable, plenty of Republicans will desperately try to justify why they enabled this. 

They must be held accountable.


-595.119613011776: ...and yet you mock &amp;. ridicule my ongoing efforts to expose the British govt doing ‘very bad things’. Its blindness to web of Trump-Russia links that lead through London. Its determination to ignore crimes committed by your Brexiteer mates. https://t.co/AirZX7EJ9X

-596.8623042550792: @TeaPainUSA That's impossible.

The GOP did it to Obama simply to be assholes.

-597.4944570865819: In all the msm punditry about the abnormality of the past 2 years, no one has acknowledged the most basic perversity of it: that Trump was able to con his way into the WH only by dint of a hideous, pervasive mass brainwashing—not about him but about his opponent. (1)

@SethAbramson is the reason I got a Twitter account and is a big part of the reason I feel like I’m months ahead of MSM, and most people I know, in expecting which shoes are about to drop.


-615.312728013103: Instead of sending our US troops to the border, President Trump should have sent personnel to help process asylum claims and provide medical care. Asylum seekers deserve care and compassion, not tear gas and turmoil.

-617.5152540382243: Trump's threats to close the goverment down over the manufactured immigrant threat is just another elaborate distraction, as was ordering border patrol to fire tear gas at unarmed migrant workers. Trump is losing it as Mueller is closing in.

-619.2871385949071: Any television channel that give air time to Trump or Sarah Sanders open up their air waves to blatant lies. The only way they could defend that would be by offering the actual (and known) facts immediately afterwards. News needs to become honest!


-620.1312040266797: If 8 years ago, when I was somehow Josh Rosen’s head coach and OC in the 8th grade, you would have told me that in 2018 he would beat Aaron Rodgers, in Green Bay, in the cold, I would have bet everything I have that there was a better chance of Donald Trump also being POTUS. #Wow

-620.5628740735881: Mr. Scheer asserts that he would abrogate international agreements in the reckless, uncooperative, and isolationist style of Mr. Trump. Canada is obliged under international law to examine asylum claims for validity. Did the MS St. Louis lesson/apology mean nothing? #cdnpoli https://t.co/2ZCBxZl8vm


-621.4175074499889: Soooo, I guess federal workers can't even urge the Russian Installation to "resist impeachment" ?  Amirite, @realDonaldTrump ?  You should really rethink this memo.  You're gonna need all the kind words, and help you can get....on your way to prison.

He died an uneventful death, without the pomp and circumstance, given to former presidents. Most people don’t remember his passing. This is Trump’s legacy, just add prison time.


-621.8842765937704: “Speaking openly to the new right, Trump is rallying and emboldening a counterrevolutionary politics. If the American people do not act soon, we risk being caught in a downward authoritarian spiral or violent civil strife.” Read on:

-623.7845480025245: Maddow w the details of Trump's 1st public declaration that the US should drop US sanctions after being asked by Russian spy Maria Butina.

-624.5876382577228: Trump G20 grade: F.  Isolated as no US president has ever been at an international summit, Trump embarrassed with his behavior, maintained a dangerous outlier stance on climate, and achieved nothing on trade. He is now a pariah and a laughing stock and US leadership has suffered.


-624.8535526285243: @bjmabm @magisano1 @tonyschwartz I might. I highly doubt it will support your claim that there was no collusion on the Trump side though.
Looks like you are a liar like Kavanaugh, so I wouldn't put a lot of faith in what you say.

Trump only values himself, how much money he rake of of government, how much dmage he can do to climate change and environment and peopl


-625.840173549048: @RawStory Trump will  bankrupt US, and have everyone on their knees, just like he did to his six companies, and still say he did a great job and how wonderful he is. He needs a mental assessment! Unfit to run a company, let alone Potus. POS!!! #25thAmendmentNow #25thAmendmentNow #FuckTrump


-626.2044774302606: 5/ I think Americans must understand that when the Mueller Report is given to DOJ sometime in mid-2019 (most likely), and after the weeks or months of legal battles thereafter allow Americans to see it, we will discover not one allegation of Trump committing a crime but *dozens*.

Do you really want to go down on the Trumptanic & &amp; ruin the remaining shreds of your reputation by spouting these ridiculous & &amp; easily disprovable lies? Why would you throw your own life away for a loser like Trump unless you, too, were in danger?

-628.564399346558: @MeetThePress @SenJohnBarrasso Yeah. International business that involved a sanctioned bank and back channel dealings that he lied about, as well as ALL his senior advisors. 

Meet the Press quoting this BS without fact check is exactly the reason why we have trump as prez. Do better @msnbc.


-628.7525444750266: @TheStagmania More and more I’m starting to think that, like Trump, he doesn’t actually want to be the nominee; his point seems to be just become the big, fat obstacle that the candidate has to deal with. He probably thinks of that role as being a “kingmaker” or some such bullshit.


-629.8019231332387: OMG, a real estate mogul working on real estate deals.  You've got @realDonaldTrump.

-631.222229606918: #Manafort was so hell-bent on getting #Pence the job that he lied to #Trump about mechanical problems on Trump's plane so that Trump would stay an extra day in Indiana, so Manafort had time to carry out his mission to add Pence.

-631.5871679342542: @mog7546 There is something there for Trump to learn, President Bush most likely hoped that Trump could him put aside to see that life is short  & &amp; words matter.  It’s a nice thought but doubtful it will happen. Sympathy to the #bush family, hard losing such a beloved family member.


-632.2162508751555: @JimericanTweets @MrsMogul @DIXIEDOODLE12 3) Why does Trump begin each day in the Oval office with a prayer associated w/JFK? Why does Q continually make references to JFK?

-634.4076850662694: Hard to believe that Donald Trump cancelled his press conference at the G20 out of  “respect” for anyone or anything. The passing of George HW Bush may have been a convenient excuse, but it’s more likely he didn’t feel like answering awkward questions. https://t.co/I55KzilQ4D


-634.7192238700155: @StormyDaniels @kathygriffin What about your claim he filed against Trump and you didnt want him to......as far as the "accounting" it sounds like you just want people to keep donating.

-635.8322451544072: @danaeward @BarbMcQuade @KatiePhang @AlexWitt Trump missed the January deadline for imposing sanctions after a GOP-controlled Congress voted to impose them for months.

-648.3644797801521: @PalmerReport @stanspak Collusion, Obstruction okay!  but I think the real issue (charge) trump is worried about is the MONEY LAUNDERING aspect more then anything else.

-651.9599306600726: Add Canada to this list. No one West of Toronto believes anything the Globalist Liberals, or many of the weak minded Conservatives for that matter, say. Politicians and a lot of the career civil servants are just lining their pockets and the pockets of their elitist masters.


-652.0316488685781: Could not agree more.   Daily, blue partisans try to turn us into enemies.  I've been attacked around 5x more by "resistance" by not following hive mind group think, than I've had Trump supporters come after me. Very very counterproductive.


-652.1479150723655: @CNNPolitics Pompeo is a disgrace to the intelligence community. As a former head of the CIA he should know how important it is for the President and those around him to give trust and support to our intelligence agencies. Proves that he is just another Trump Stooge.


-652.7268792078464: @AARPadvocates Curiously, the MSM never covered the fact that President Trump signed a bill that lowered over 970 prescription drugs about 3 weeks ago. There’s already good things happening in the WH on this front, if you’re honest abt it.

-657.9748676641433: @badgalredi The fact that Trump is soooo far right, he makes conservatives like Bush sound normal. I always say this, Republicans win because they are never afraid to be hypocritical.


-658.1195623085677: Salt Lake City police Detective Greg Wilking said “We don’t want to ignore a hate crime if it’s a hate crime, but we don’t want to make it a hate crime if there’s not that aspect of it.” LETS BE CLEAR IT IS A HATE CRIME!!! @SaltLakeCity_NC


-658.2726636950886: #Trump has brushed aside questions about the loss of the chamber entirely, ridiculing losing incumbents by name

Meanwhile continuing to demand Congress fund a border wall despite his party losing many of their most diverse districts.

#MOG


-658.7000853179167: 😂😂😂😂😂 At 1st the democrats thought trump was making up the caravan invasion, Oh boy is the egg ever on their faces.

 And I hope President Trump does shut down government until he gets the funding for the wall.


-659.3139485146714: @Wingate_51 @Sublimateus So dumb. You have zero evidence Trump received anything from Russia.

The democrats on the other hand... gave 20% of USA Uranium to Russia... 

Who signed off? 

Obama, Hillary, Mueller, and all the democrats... several of whom were PAID off by Russia!

Your liberals are crooks!


-659.8323484704113: @5ilence_d0g00d @harjo111 @GilbertSandi @SenatorMenendez No...Trump shouldn't get involved in a matter between a citizen and his own country...but, there is a moral principle here that shouldn't be ignored...when we put money and power over another's life...we become democrats

-660.5616903685915: @mmpadellan Trump chooses this one time to not say anything g since he has nothing nice to say.


-661.0058406821174: @WyattEarpLA And that’s just what the military  and law enforcement in this country would do if necessary to back Trump. Believe it. You ever notice anyone who backs MSM in uniform?


-662.564641656938: You can't have it both ways Roger. The "I'm just a brillint BS political prankster"routine is OLD... When evidence pops up to prove your actions are NOT "spin" but, in fact, actual collusion, you get caught."Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall" Roj


-663.417885579556: By the time the following video had been shot, Trump had been accused by Ivanka's mother of a brutal rape & &amp; of sexually assaulting another woman.

Trump agrees that he's a sexual predator. @IvankaTrump response? Inappropriate giggling.

Ivanka Trump ...

-663.498499060584: For the record:

There is absolutely nothing suspicious about Rupert Murdoch being under investigation over Trump and Russian loans, suddenly selling most of his family business and suffering a near fatal accident (on a yacht) which was covered up for 2 weeks.

Nothing at all.


-664.099718129271: As the walls continue to close in on Trump, and the likelihood of him being removed before the end of his first term increase, we must remember that: Mike Pence was picked by Manafort, knew about everything, lied about everything, and must also be removed.
https://t.co/ywUf1QTzCW


-664.2685263712825: Trump will sell America out to any murderous country or dictator in order to make $$ for himself. 
Putin & &amp; MBS OWN Trump who is afraid to stand up to either & &amp; ruin his business interests. 
Trump is a traitor to America, screwing our country in favor of $$ from these murderers. ⬇️ https://t.co/J1Dh6RxjkR


-665.4954714813948: The fact that President Trump keeps furtively pursuing these contacts with Putin, contrary to his domestic political interest and without any clear strategic rationale, is one of the most perplexing aspects of his presidency—and should be one of the scariest. https://t.co/VZM5MTZ0sk


-665.8360617062131: If you haven't already, and if you can stomach it, see how many images of Trump you can find at the recent  G20 summit. 

Now see if you can find one, just one. that makes you think he looks comfortable, and represents The United States of America like a POTUS should...


-666.0791330312862: I've seen a lot of people use the word "hate" about both Trump and Obama.

The difference is that with Trump - they have a ton to refer to (lies, policies, treason, what he says, his business dealings, Mueller, Russia, etc.)

With Obama - I get nothing

"Hate" is a harsh word btw


-667.4378778388796: This is exactly what we need to be doing, while furiously working to hold Trump's Regime accountable! And if the GOP refuse to get on board, like this thread says - all the better for us in 2020. 

PS. This bill is exciting. https://t.co/UH8SxNbjpN


-667.9491112113204: “It’s possible the 2018 midterm disaster was caused by Trump, but it’s equally possible it was caused by policies of GOP. These policies are designed to appeal to a racist, white base of voters who do not want a democracy if it includes giving minority voters equal voting rights” https://t.co/65SrGB5Nlk


-668.3324079393989: @GOP @realDonaldTrump @SenMikeLee What track record? What are you talking about? He has put us close to the brink of nuclear war!! I can’t wait for Trump and his family to actually see just how good our federal sentencing system truly is!!!


-668.9581677856995: @WrathOfKhan2016 @realDonaldTrump I hope Trump comes home to find a new ‘friend’ in residence tonight. If it is who I think it might be let it be as Don, Jr. said, “I love it.” That man is taller than he is and no longer has a care in the world. 
#HauntedByGhostOfPatriots


-669.0902703884174: @RadioFreeTom That's true. Trump's cult would have and did vote for and defend him no matter what evil crimes he had and continues to commit because they are lost. They don't know who they and are looking to be led, even to the point of going over a cliff

-670.351165264726: @bwh333 Pompeo is referred to as respected because the bar has been set so low & &amp; it's all in comparison to people like Pruitt & &amp; Whitaker. Any Trump appointee who's not an obvious felon has the respect of mostly every Republican in Congress. #PartisanHacks


-671.4198933353151: @sewwutnow @MissILmom Remember he's trying to destroy America not build America up that's why they hate Trump are all working to destroy America for the one world order


-672.2326622148154: You won't. History will be kind to him eventually and he may be recognized as the best ever while Obama's LEGACY is going to be as one of the most corrupt presidents ever elected.


-672.3302995381888: The real fake news will happen after Donald Trump dies and the media only runs the good stuff HE did. Luckily, that clip will only run 20 seconds and half of it will be firing Omarosa on The Apprentice.


-672.694393677577: @washingtonpost I agree... Trump should emulate him more.   I don't like Trump;s style usually but he is not just a suit like Obama was... he really is doing great considering 95% of the media is trying to take him down daily.   Libs forget that half of the country do not agree with them at all


-672.9361530246649: There is absolutely no doubt that MBS is behind Khashoggi slaughter. Khashoggi knew how dangerous MBS is and referred to him as a “beast.” The Putin bro handshake is nauseating. There is very suspicious connection between Kushner/Trump and MBS that needs to be looked at. https://t.co/xiOvhGiZLx


-673.1035888428505: @WhiteHouse Dear friends,Left Democrats are the most racist & &amp; antisemitic. Real support to the Jewish people, Hispanics, African American, blue collar workers have come from Mr Trump since 2016. Our gratitude to our President from people who fight with you for a better country for our kids.


-673.9092513501799: I know a lot on the left won’t be missing Daddy Bush.

trump gives the rich a BIG tax break..... trumps accountants are aware of every loophole and take advantage of them. Democrats are the ones who allowed all these loopholes..... We need a flat tax.....


-674.5367974080331: @AdamMSnow @Ziggiezaggie @BarackObama @FoodDepository I could type up a lot of quotes from the last 3 years that point otherwise, but there really isn't any point. Statistically, there has  been a rise in hate crimes since Trump took office. He makes them feel safe providing there brand of perverted justice. https://t.co/OY8ZWIie4v


-674.835995075064: From a practical standpoint, Putin is still trying to sway American elections and Trump is using his authority to proverbially wave his hands telling people to look the other way. 

That is an illegal agreement, criminal intent and proof of an overt act. That is Conspiracy.


-675.3864161299493: @th3j35t3r This is concerning. Trump behaves like he doesn't know where he is. He gets the same look on his face that an elderly family member who is now lost to dementia would get.


-675.5633241201425: Trump has always done business by promising things with no intention of delivering.  Russia is realizing they've been "Trumped". And their press would not say anything Putin didn't approve. https://t.co/U3FrKyyOxj


-676.038907626643: @OkCallMeAL I know people who delt with trump and they thought he was an idiot in the 80s and now they think he’s a bigger idiot he hasn’t learned a thing in 25 years he thinks money can buy anything but you can’t buy intelligence integrity or respect it has to be earned and learned


-676.3040846624953: .@realDonaldTrump, you  secretly asked Putin’s office for help re a Trump tower project in Moscow that would earn you millions. And you told the public you “stayed away” from Russia. So you colluded & &amp; lied. Now you continue the con & &amp; hope to sucker your supporters. What a fake. https://t.co/rz61OLIFkO


-679.1115365616022: @rubashov_ @FDRLST > &gt; Modern public square.

Do refer to decision re: Trump's account as well ("public forum"),

While internet isn't that new, it's only grown more widespread over time and social media has become exactly that. Laws haven't quite caught up to it, but we'll get there given time.


-679.6923801894271: #KEYTHOUGHTS: Some things to note on Michael Cohen's guilty plea today for lying to Congress about his efforts to negotiate a Trump Tower Moscow deal w/ Russia during 2016.

1/ It's no coincidence that this comes TWO DAYS before Trump's next scheduled meeting w/ Putin at the G20. https://t.co/uyTdxGw9o9


-679.7706012323886: Trump and his cronies are a Fifth Column.  The damage they're doing is enormous.  So much will have to be rebuilt -- but better, stronger, and resistant to the weaknesses in our society and system that allowed that illegitimate regime to usurp power and wreak havoc. https://t.co/FyTFwzW2S2


-679.8877522140358: Howard Dean: “I find fascinating is how much jeopardy is the president’s legal team in?” “If the president’s legal team was colluding with Cohen to lie - concoct Cohen’s lie then they’re in trouble and not just the president. This is a really big problem”  https://t.co/tUSmZ43uyr


-680.7870603632432: Have you ever noticed how many jokes that rely on some kind of knee-jerk reaction like "LOL GAY" also end up being, by some weeeeeeeeeeeird coincidence, just lazy as fuck?


-680.8993997166133: If Trump weren’t President, he’d already be charged with crimes, if not, in prison. We should hold the American president to the highest standards, not the lowest. His lies, the potential of criminal charges and the many different investigations alone warrant removal from office.


-682.5363667372793: So I’ve been going through it because my mom had another stroke on Monday but today during speech therapy when asked who the president is she said “the crazy guy.”

Then when asked who the president before trump was my mom said “the cute guy.”

Personality is still there! ❤️🙏🏾😂


-683.0209962490359: In the dark recesses of Trump megalomaniacal mind lurks the dawning awareness that his outrageous lies will not save him this time and he will at last face retribution.

Despicable. https://t.co/l0lgArTGyX


-686.2855043098102: This is disgusting. Not sure what is worse, that our foreign policy is being dictated by the financial influence countries hold over trump, or that no one in the complicit @GOP is bothering to call him out for it. Bunch of traitorous fucks. https://t.co/G8zO04LRLY


-686.3691280076686: He is a demented, unpredictable, child like man. We are all afraid of him because he is ignorant, narcissistic and cruel.  We don’t understand how his mind works.

-691.6422060228842: @CNNPolitics It would only be fair to allow the American people to hear the question of the former FBI director Donald Trump needs to be questioned it’s a sham not allowing Donald Trump to be question he is the one who trying to shut down the investigation well hoping the FBI Gloves off

-693.1513058551078: @TheRickWilson I truly hope that those responsible for this long lasting national Trump fiasco are actually capable of learning from their shameful and embarrassing mistake of electing and defending the indefensibly potentially globally fucked up pile of ungodly matter known as Donald Trump.


-693.2693615755221: House Ds overperformed top of ticket, netted seats in ‘16. They voted to change rules, make dccc chair elected position. There was even an “autopsy” (lol).

-693.7336224134295: So the goofball liar decided to come out of hiding.

-696.5794211252637: The thing about Trump's putrid combo of malice and an utter lack of loyalty is that his associates surely know, now that he is president, he's more likely to wield that extraordinary power to hurt them than to help them. So they know their best bet is to try to disempower him.


-698.790978412375: So what! I don’t care what Trump did or wanted to do before he became President! Just making another mountain out of a mole hill!!

It is the worst since the beginning of time


-706.1987573594935: The Trump government cares deeply about education. They are doing all they can to make sure American kids don't get any. They're against science, critical thinking, etc, but pro-indoctrination.

And people wonder why we compare them to totalitarian regimes.


-706.2150710096225: Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement seems like a stroke of genius now.

Not to be too full of cynicism, but I fear this is simply a fabricated crisis by a failing, fraudulent administration. Shut the war drums down.


-715.2255034869329: @jacobsoboroff Umm... 90% of heroin & &amp; other drugs comes through the southern border that lacks a Border Wall. Not sure how much that has to do with China.

The majority of fetanyl is due to China. No one is disputing that. Think you're way off base here.

-716.176634884292: By coming clean about his lies, Michael Cohen may have put Trump at serious risk. If the president and his lawyers thought that they might sneak something by Robert Mueller’s team, it is too late to change tactics now. https://t.co/J6nEPAffZ9


-716.2706046177464: @ProudResister @MichaelAvenatti @Suzierizzo1 @MichaelCohen212 He can take him down but he still deserves to be punished for conspiring against America. He’s not doing this to help us, he got caught and he cut a deal, I give you trump and I get no sentence. He would still be helping trump if he hadn’t been caught


-716.5857637507814: When put together, the two federal climate reports released last Friday show that the cost of meeting the Paris Agreement target is equivalent to 5-20 years’ worth of damages (and of course if we don’t, we’ll be looking at decades of damages this century alone). https://t.co/urOCWYfysf


-717.0264529153246: As anyone with sales experience knows, deals "die" and come back to life all the time.

Cohen may have plead "guilty" to lying on this to get a lighter sentence, but in actuality, he didn't lie.  It was nuance. https://t.co/DMcRUqPAWz


-717.5445891539772: Everytime something good starts to go on in the reality TV of the Russia investigation, I think Trump has some body important die to kill the news cycle for 3 days.... R.I.P. but damn man... These like long ass commercial breaks....


-718.31024535633: @mdcolli @verucasalt10 @dthomicide Each time you say that, my spine cringes cause it scares me like nothing else possibly could, and couldn't be more accurate. Just so you know, I breathe deeply and think of Mueller and seems Putin's about done with Trump considering how Putin seemed to dis him in BA.


-718.7868056631819: BUT~ will he wait til he leaves the summit and tweet out something cowardly and stupid on Air Force One, like he did to Trudeau? We all know he can't disagree to face to face. Trump agrees to freeze higher tariffs on $200M in Chinese goods — for now.

-719.8385083386114: Flake is a selfish narcissist who would stop one of the few things he actually could do for his country-confirm responsible judges.  His hate of @realDonaldTrump exceeds his sense of duty.  His proposal is unconstitutional anyway. Good riddance! Go hide in an elevator! https://t.co/tvnGrESClQ


-719.9041847770851: I understand the skepticism here, but think about it logically for a minute. What else can McConnell possibly hope to gain from Trump? The House isn’t going to let anything through. The agenda is dead. Mitch’s legacy is set. He stacked SCOTUS, now he has to try and save 2020.


-721.03140751547: Imagine a political attack ad showing Trump saying "we stayed away from Russia" & &amp; that his his lawyer Michael Cohen is a "good man." The ad shows Cohen going to prison & &amp; saying they offered to give Putin a $50 million penthouse condo in Trump Tower Moscow.  #VoteBlue2020


-721.6669285107852: @RudyGiuliani Hopefully your enabling of Trump’s corruption will land you a much deserved indictment too, Rudy. Your arrogance, stupidity and complete defiance to upholding the rule of law makes you a co-conspirator to a man who is so obviously guilty.


-721.9814998468354: "Trump not only doesn’t care about the next generation, he doesn’t seem to care about anything other than his personal image in the present day"


-722.1035941227785: For decades idiotic, hack politicians allowed China to push us around and rip us off. China rose to become a world superpower while America stayed stagnant.

Sorry, not holding my breath.

Hillary destroyed subpoenaed evidence, engaged in massive influence peddling & &amp; committed many violations of secrecy laws. Obama tools engaged in a massive conspiracy to illegally spy on Trump's campaign & &amp; destroy his presidency.

No consequences.

-724.146194184863: How many voters would have changed their minds if they had known that Trump’s campaign conspired to meet with people working for the Kremlin in Trump Tower, or that his campaign chairman was a criminal, or that he was actively seeking a deal with Putin months before the election?


-724.2772815692819: Why in early 2016 would anyone have cared what business The Trump Organization was doing in Russia? Russia was not on the radar of the electorate. It was only after HRC impossibly lost that the Obama administration & &amp; liberal media began the Russian collusion delusion narrative.


-725.2725746848148: What NPR’s fake story revealed today is how many self-styled Trump/Russia experts don’t actually know a thing about the facts of the story. They’ve read none of the transcripts, none of the source documents, all the while smugly posing as authorities. https://t.co/x40JpYr67w


-725.6942573903717: .Here are 4 problems with the new climate change report.

-728.7634514586333: @andybattles @Dr_Xun @SkillUpYT @izren_jpg Lol I see what you guys are getting at. I personally just hate all the negativity around trump tbh. Yes he does stupid stuff but all it's doing is spreading so much negativity and it just saddens me to see it. Like, why not try to spread positivity and encourage your president..


-729.0558585654878: Putin says “war will continue” as long as the Ukrainian govt in power and Mattis just confirmed that Russia tried to interfere in our elections last month. Trump meanwhile is trying so hard to see Putin even for a sec and has his WH calling to propose continued contacts w Kremlin https://t.co/8WqrBruEtp


-729.4795926289137: With an ignorant reckless POTUS and a feckless cowardly GOP, it’s reassuring to know that our judiciary is holding. CJ Roberts’ rebuke to Trump is a strong indication that he will not allow a pathologically lying malignant narcissist to destroy our Democracy.


-729.7642123202293: We genuinely aren't far off Trump crapping or pissing himself UK public.... it's so obvious hes struggling. He may even have done it and we dont know yet... all these sudden ending of events etc

-733.9157069934682: @Atseawall @marcorubio We are a Rubio cult,  according to some.. I've been called a Rubio rah rah. 🙄They're mad because he doesn't attack POTUS. He does but supposedly not enough.  If @marcorubio did more, Trump would no longer call him for foreign policy input.  At least now he has some influence.


-734.1433929663348: HHS Sec Alex Azar testified before Congress that if they wanted kids returned to their families it will require legislation. Otherwise, Trump will continue to have families held & &amp; children separated, & &amp; "no one is getting a kid back unless they’re on the way out of the country."


-734.5831705515827: @PersuasivePR You cannot be surprised, collins is just as bad as the rest of the putin/trump corruption party members. She supports racism, taking women's rights away and how much money has she taken from the foreign government's?


-735.3949673764207: Trump has manufactured a crisis on the border. I spent all day yesterday talking to asylum seekers, people from the caravan, & &amp; Mexican authorities. We simply need to go back to an orderly process & &amp; allow asylum seekers to apply for refuge from death. https://t.co/QO4xTxG6f3


-736.604164766701: Mueller brings process cases like Cohen’s pleading guilty to lying to Congress and threatens similar cases against Cohen and  Corsi. These cases, and all so far,  demonstrate no evidence of Trump collusion and are “...full of sound and fury signifying.”


-737.0092522278767: Day 682: Trump pincushion "Lyin'" Ted Cruz says the nickname should be retired. Unfortunately for him he doesn't get to decide what other people refer to him as, especially when he rolls onto his back for a guy who relentlessly shamed him. Trump meanwhile, avoids media. #resist


-737.9238109715635: Criminal Cohen pled to 8 felonies and is now asking the sentencing judge to limit his punishment to the few hours he was in custody. What a complete joke. He lied to the courts and the American people for months. All in an effort to help Trump. He deserves real jail time. #Basta


-737.9861283471812: @Atruerepublica1 @EOpen42 @led21776718 @nowthisnews You posted the fake meme. You should answer to what you use. Would you like me to find your post of your fake Trump hate hoaxes?


-738.267016322892: i heard that idiot Limbaugh say today "nobody could have built a business out of nothing like trump did". First, you moron, he got $431 million from his father. Second, arguably without laundered money from Russians, he would be broke

-739.1071441662189: He just throws shit on the ground ... trump is hot garbage. He can’t even get the small stuff right.

Imagine the nightmare of a person he would be without his massive inherited wealth.

It’s infuriating to see someone so truly worthless who is worth so much. https://t.co/m7cdGbggn1


-739.3195655315596: 2/ For instance, if Cohen kept Trump apprised of every development in a single deal involving Russia from 2015 to 2016, why would *anyone* still believe Trump was *not* told in advance by his son of a gaggle of powerful Russians coming to his house (Trump Tower) on June 9, 2016?


-739.8255218853996: @NancyBelton7 @Lee_in_Iowa I doubt that. Putin would NEVER allow the appearance of backing down from such an idiot as Trump, nor from anyone far smarter, for any purpose. I don't think he cares one whit about making Trump look like a hero. When the time comes, he'll relish making him look the idiot he is.


-741.0704954063851: They're not following anyone's lead, they're following the real scientists (not the phony "Science Guy" on TV), who know that no one can stop climate change! Can you stop the sun from getting hotter? Can you stop the Antartic from melting bcs of the sun? How stupid liberals are!!


-741.4194323498798: The far better trade deal that Democrats previously said could never be renegotiated.  Democrats would rather hurt American than give another win to President Trump.


-741.6538225190233: This short clip of Obama has it all:

- Mocks Ebola outbreak that killed thousands
- Mocks press for caring about Hillary's e-mails.
- Mocks Trump for cell phone use
- Says "a bunch of poor refugees" not a threat
-  Says Trump moving troops to border is "a political stunt"

The President is credibly accused of raping a 13-yr-old. His nomination of SCOTUS Bro went forward despite *mountains* of evidence of sexual misconduct. These are features, not bugs.


-746.3798417501138: Voter fraud elected em-so why would they risk the truth coming out? Our elections are a sham-have been for many yrs. Their blatant disregard of the law is escalating yearly because of zero consequences-As a result-Calif's the poverty capital of the nation

-747.6153013490773: It’s incredibly sad that an entire political party turned their back on the American people when they were needed the most. 

The GOP is complicit in every single one of Trump’s harmful policies and history will not be kind to them.


-749.0983290904313: Failure to lead on this issue continues to be one of the most disastrous aspects of the Trump presidency.

-750.234444242055: Trump destroys his enemies not by silencing them, but by sunlighting them - like vampires. He puts them center-stage, hands them the mic and lets them destroy themselves. He is not trying to make Democrats stop being Democrats, He is making them show who they really are.


-750.5865076431421: @realannapaulina @Lbaygal We're going to have to Kill those who Support this. There is No Other Way? Voting doesn't work? Trump can't get anything done? I wish ppl would realize this? It's over Unless we Organize and Destroy the Scum that has Overpowered our Nation.


-750.737178334851: Trump has forced the globalists to speed up their plans, or maybe just driven them so insane that they no longer care to hide their cancer behind a facade. Puppeteers who aren't completely rabid are frantically trying to pump the brakes/warning that it's doing damage 2 the agenda https://t.co/MgHwT1o6dK


-750.7652500033329: Want to know why they hate Trump?

-782.6104103274799: Because he's NOT.

He's not even a Democrat, FFS!

And folks who think he's just gonna reap the nomination & &amp; Democratic votes as spoils for hamstringing our party all the way to the election against Trump in 2016 have another thing coming! Hell NO.

Chemical weapons like tear gas are banned in war.

The Trump admin used tear gas on kids in diapers.

Congress should outlaw use of tear gas on kids.

-786.9737463090919: @RobertNiven7 @MunroeBergdorf 1. We all know we can't change DNA. You act like that is some trump card for your anti trans agenda, but really it's level 1 basic knowledge. You're not clever for pointing this out. 

2. Science has proven thousands of times that gender dysphoria exists, so...?


-788.6421203921459: Don't evaluate people like Putin & &amp; Trump or predict their actions based on what you or other normal people would do. Most people cannot lie constantly in full view, for example. For them, it's easy & &amp; natural.


-789.5589715330904: This man has led his entire adult life with a blatant disregard of human rights or decency. He's well hated by the world, even by those whom he threw in with Now that his murderous Masters got him to destroy America and leave us limping and ripe 4 the picking, he will die in jail


-790.1044796103139: Sadly this denial exemplifies the devastating power of accusing others of what you did. 

SOMETHING HIGHLY ILLEGAL HAPPENED.

Hillary & &amp; Obama through immediate surrogates + GPS conspired to bring a KNOWN SANCTIONED RUSSIAN SPY to Trump Tower to falsely corroborate a fake dossier! https://t.co/McDiIBCWWW


-791.5575559258695: Didn't click but imagining him saying something like, "I'd like a billionaire, someone from a large liberal state, someone who's proven to be anti-Trump, maybe even someone who's already running ads…"


-791.6465196884429: Wonder if this idiot knows that Russian lawyer Netskya, or whatever, also worked with Fusion GPS, people who helped Hillary create fake Dossier? This guy Cohen is a kunting lawyer, just like Avenatti or the guy who killed Anna-Nicole Smith and claimed fatherhood of her baby. https://t.co/ksbrZsy8FU


-792.8595487283532: Trump looks for people who share his disregard for the truth and are willing to parrot him, "even if it's a lie, even if they know it's a lie, and even if he said the opposite the day before," said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. https://t.co/ug53AUeh8D


-793.8937058599419: @NekishaCosey @LisaM3732 @ProudResister @MichaelAvenatti I like his fighting spirit to take on tRump but he needs to pick his battles and be a bit more Machiavelli like INMO @MichaelAvenatti but he's right it's going to take a fighter to take his dumb ass down.


-795.8231273026379: Neil DeGrasse Tyson, rabid liberal fake scientist & &amp; Trump critic, is facing allegations of rape, misogynistic comments and inappropriate sexual advances.

Globalist Communist MSM calling DeGrasse rape "sexual misconduct"

Another Democrat rapist gets a pass. Hypocrites!


-795.8314067125061: As the lies, corruption & &amp; criminality are laid bare, as the indictments, guilty pleas & &amp; imprisonment mount, as the mockery, sidelining & &amp; hostility by allies intensifies, it’s hard to imagine this installed occupant of the WH will survive to run again. https://t.co/35CImpjd0k


-796.2676132684594: @kenolin1 Ca will never allow this to happen on our coast so the east coast needs to do the same thing.  I refuse to weep about it.  I encourage others to fight back and sue if they have to.  Trump isn't the only one with a say so here.  These are our oceans.


-796.7782776811688: I am compelled for reasons unknown even to myself to watch every SNL episode and I can say with total conviction that the Trump era political sketches are the worst content the show has ever produced.


-797.0596273507144: Now that Dems set a precedent for sexual abuse allegations (all are believable; every alleged abuser guilty), let's turn our attention to Keith Ellison.

-797.9569673532719: @RepAdamSchiff When Donald trump called for the lifting of sanctions on Russia, it wasn’t about improving relations.  It was about helping him get a loan from a sanctioned Russian bank to build a trump tower in Moscow. How many times must America get betrayed and insulted before we clean house?


-798.2838720316876: @billmaher Bill, I am not sure if you know exactly how many loyal viewers you have lost due to the pissing match between HBO and Dish network. All the bullshit of the Trump WH defined clearly, and the view from the sorta left is now invisible..kinda censor by omission ya think!


-798.9572351069388: UK #FakeNews won't report this, but one of the wins Trump made in US-China trade was a crack down on illegal drugs that will reduce the number of UK deaths

I recon this could save hundreds of lives every year

As someone who has lost family to drugs I thank you @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/CLlnPSD7Ey


-800.1722804191479: @dbongino The Russia hysteria is now on Fox News at full throttle. Almost all Sunday shows are saying Cohen guilty plea has put President Trump in an impeachment course. And Bushist Ari Fleischer’s help are saying Trump already lost 2020 re-election. Trump’s counterattacks coming!


-801.0911084666382: Trump wants to shutdown the government if he doesn't get funding for his xenophobic, anti-immigrant, and racist border wall. Here's how to call your members of Congress and tell them not to fund the border wall:  https://t.co/2ayRYsLrYi
 https://t.co/TjIIfbpYBJ


-801.3452829980027: @derekahunter @StefanMolyneux @CNN @brianstelter Very weirdly written. You can’t trust anything CNN reports anymore, always twisted to push their narrative. They even pondered why people weren’t blaming OPEC or Trump.


-801.7980904522927: @AnandWrites He did Iran contra to steal the election. Set up the election system so that Republicans could deny people their right to vote which got trump into office among many other traitors now working for putin and their own bank accounts.


-802.4212329109345: @wdunlap @DiamondandSilk #MAGA #Trump45 #AmericaFirst   @SKSSKanz  The women on that show are totally irrelevant due to their inane hatred and intolerance toward President Trump and anything conservative. They are actually comedic versions of themselves. 😐


-804.5744645120581: It has been nearly 2 years since someone illegally leaked the details of General Flynn's call with Kislyak. It's been 18 months since someone illegally leaked info on Page's FISA. Not one person has been charged with those criminal leaks. What a failure: https://t.co/7LboHmlccT


-806.3405358876491: Whatever you do don’t retweet this video I found of Donald Trump Jr saying he’s “been to Russia many times” & &amp; saying he “spent a lot of time looking at deals in Moscow in 2005-2006 & &amp; 2007.” It could make him absolutely furious and expose him as a liar. https://t.co/VXW2MvGCwE


-806.6139115282942: This next month will be chaotic. Both sides will be taking big final swings before the Democratic House convenes in early January. I’ll try to interpret the chaos in real time, as best I can. But Mueller has the upper hand over Trump. He always has. Now we’ll get to see his hand.


-807.014924564643: Why does anyone have to prove people like #Comey should be prosecuted!? Well, it is because of the gross incompetence of #Mueller who I feel must be a cretin. Trump legal team makes case to prosecute Comey, others for lying after  https://t.co/bDPVZsvffB via @washtimes


-807.7482350279207: Put Trump's excessive need to control together with his demand of total loyalty & &amp; general mistrust of others & &amp; I really cannot see room to doubt that he micromanaged the international scheming from behind the scenes, with full knowledge of every detail of negotiations


-808.2932795338228: @MSNBC "Trump's administration ----- has yet to offer evidence or say how officials identified more than 500 alleged criminals within the caravan of Central American migrants traveling toward the U.S. border with Mexico." Uh, that's because he made it up at the top of his demented head.


-809.200901771926: The United States public health services is a uniform service of the United States that is designed to assist in these kind of public health problems-give them the mission and they will make sure that these children are taken care of.

-814.02649664248: Six Trump administration officials were found to have misused their official positions for partisan politics in violation of a law called the Hatch Act, in response to complaints brought by @CREWcrew, for a total of 9 violations following our complaints. https://t.co/hxFEPQNZCm


-814.0926329502093: @BabyTrump11 @tribelaw @SethAbramson The military was almost depleted thanks to Obama, Trump put money back into the military instead of cutting funds like obama did. Trump has secured our borders and is pushing the EU to get off the dependency of russian gas....


-814.8519389461064: @crosillo47 @KellyannePolls Now that HW Bush has passed President Trump needs to unredact his name from the JFK assassination report? With everyone praising Papa Bush for being such an incredible man I think the American people have every right to know the truth about who this career criminal really was.


-816.9948794992592: @BernardKerik @realDonaldTrump @BillClinton @BarackObama Build the Wall. Looks like they all should agree. Unless their still in the "out to get Trump mode" instead of helping America stand strong and protecting our citizens. Just follow the law and come into the country legally.


-817.2856812009221: Putin might be a KGB thug but he is not the source of our problems. Our problems stem from a large group of people
in government, finance, Hollywood and the news media trying desperately to get Trump out of office so they can continue to steal our country!


-817.7026155229956: @Jasonfest @dylanmsmitty It is sexist to think that he made her better at all. It was her effort & &amp; outreach that made her better not him.

Bernie used the same slander that the GOP used to attack her from the left flank. He weakened her candidacy greatly by giving the GOP slander legitimacy helping tRump


-818.9565008457881: Do you get the reason for #GITMOTV now, folks?

-820.3324571069297: @kevinernste @gregolear @NOW1SOLAR Trump would nominate a replacement. Has to be house and Senate confirmed. I wouldn't be surprised that whoever he picks would get confirmed, even with a house majority for dems. The optics would look really bad if they voted against any current house or Senate member


-820.6565710683007: as you watch our president wander aimlessly on stage at the G20, glassy-eyed and lost in a fugue state of borne of stress, fatigue and the ever-encroaching fog of dementia, you can't help but start to feel sorry for him but then you remember it's Trump and ha ha, fuck him forever


-820.8010647138927: "Here's the bottom line: Nobody is coming into our country unless they come in legally." We have to take into consideration what is driving people to come here. Never an excuse to put someone's physical health on the line #fresheyes https://t.co/If1qVQhQvz


-823.0744060268833: @JuddApatow Trump's trick is getting people to be afraid of him. Yes, he's a malignant narcissist with a sadistic streak. But he is not tough, can't stand pain - psychological pain, anyway. Anyone can take him down who just keeps coming at him.


-823.1818350903222: @kenolin1 WTF!!!
How could anyone with any common decency follow his order? Trump has put oil and gas companies importance over every human being, every animal, bird and fish; all our environmental health. 
Live with that, Trump base.


-825.7336499280219: @TomiLahren The difference, #NaziBarbie, is that we don't want our country harmed by a Russian owned stooge. You fuckers could care less, as long as Trump hates brown people as much as you do. #MuellerIsComing #MaxineIsComing #CohenIsSinging

-825.9721018581876: It’s terrifying how real news gets buried in our everyday cycle. Sure, memes about Trump getting jealous over the Putin-Saudi Prince bromance is funny n all, but in real life, republicans stole/destroyed absentee ballots in North Carolina. This should be on every front page.

-828.3655062263599: @jdawsey1 I have not seen any negative tweets from the Bush family nor a press release from family spokesperson. Should Trump attend I believe that goes to the graciousness of George HW Bush. We must not promote divisive behavior during the Bush families time of grief


-830.7647773080355: It's all aboug furthering news cycle about racism Trump Administration's bring to US & &amp; NOTHING to due with Snipes's incompetence and corruption.

-846.5978306757316: @BetteMidler People like you are why Trump will win again. You don’t know what you are talking about. I am neither one of those things.

-847.5791555117316: A decent person might express remorse for insulting a recently passed President.

-848.261255936505: 12/ Why did Trump want Cohen to say negotiations with Putin ended pre-Iowa? Because he knew he'd be accused of defrauding voters if anyone knew "he was secretly negotiating a multi-billion dollar real estate deal with Putin" while lying daily re: the basis for his Russia policy.


-849.4456226337047: Criminals that caused our country harm like Uranium one deal sold our Uranium to the Russians for Clinton to use the money to run for President now that's something that really needs talked about not Trumps own business of building Hotels what idiots leftist are.


-850.2856411637555: Call me crazy, but… Does anyone else find it strange that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia wasn’t able to kill someone without the entire world knowing exactly how they did it? I mean there’s audio tape… evil and incompetent... and a Trump family friend.


-853.9717720679569: The danger here is not only the use of blackmail and threats, and the release of material threatening US safety -- but also the likelihood of total fabrication from Trump camp in order to punish enemies, purge ranks, initiate military conflicts, etc There's no shame and no limit. https://t.co/6bGoijyhML

-866.4117338948721: @briebriejoy I think a lot of liberals don't get how poisoned the Democrat label is in much of rural America. When leftists organize in rural areas w/o the burden of that label, they often get a better reaction. For example, see this under-read op-ed:
https://t.co/X8u4LgkHyx


-866.5395519072528: When law and order and justice eventually catch up to Trump, and it will happen, the story won't be about Trump being guilty.  The story will be why did the GOP let him get away with it for years?  Why did they obstruct justice for a crook, conman and traitor?


-866.9343443558191: @SenGillibrand What about all the people like me whom people like yourself show cruelty, indefferanve, and hatred. Would you also show me the same respect? No. You will continue to try to suppress my voice, relegion and morales. President Trump is not the enemy. Tribalism is.


-868.9842713888157: @krassenstein Do it Lindsey Graham! If Hillary is guilty of wrong doing, go after her. If Trump has broken the law he should have to pay the price. Why do you let anyone get away with being a crook?


-869.8175539182489: I do not believe Trump who says that tear gas he authorized to be sprayed on women and children was not harmful. Who can believe a man who can't tell the truth about anything. HE says what comes into his head. Monster.


-870.5013931288948: @8nt2_old @Lrihendry Agree 👆🏼💯Where  did Jerry Brown get  33 million dollars from ?  Trump just gave our tax dollars to Rebuild CA & &amp; help the people who lost everything Why is Brown helping non citizens before the citizens-we know why- for Democrat Voters💯🇺🇸


-872.6480833581858: 1/ A key Trump camp lie that died this week was that Trump was aloof from virtually every campaign conversation that could possibly have had legal ramifications. Cohen now tells us how closely Trump followed every development. We'll discover that that was true *across the board*.


-872.8135909444753: @RudyGiuliani Do you actually have a law degree? He lied about significant underlying facts. He lied to cover Trump's attempt to collude with Putin during Trump's candidacy in which Trump knew Putin was attacking U,S. election to help him while simultaneously lying about "no deals w/Russia."


-873.0387235160644: Trump has caused such upset. Many of us grew up looking up to our POTUS. We told our kids to look up to him, to model him, to try and be like him. And now, we tell them the POTUS is a lying POS, do NOT look up to him and for Gods sake do not ever try to be like him.


-874.7069883046678: If democrats think they're going to filibuster the USMCA while focusing on Russia and Trump's tax returns, then they'll get killed in swing states in 2020.

-887.0855764635875: We still don’t know if Mueller will indict Trump—or thinks he can indict a US president.

-890.3877220234393: Mr. Trump, your assumption that poor people admires you and overlook your lack of compassion for them is unreal. Your full of selfishness and inhuman worldwide exposures in your words and actions gives you a 0.0 respect as a world leader for the justice and goodness to all people


-890.396188266642: @diannaeanderson It’s racism hidden in the guise of religion. You wouldn’t imagine how many people I’ve cornered about why they love Trump and hated Obama and in the end they babble a scripture at me and say it’s what “they believe”.  🙄 No policy or anything mind you.


-891.6073364443316: @HagueInstitute  Citizens of the U.S. implore the UN to help us bring attention to the corruption in our government, the crimes against humanity being committed by the administration of Donald Trump,  by his the unlawful seizure and holding of refugee children.


-893.178211960923: Killing innocent humans is not healthcare. It causes shockwaves of harm that's injurious to mental health &amp;death obliterates health. A corpse is not healthy. Doctors are tethered to do no harm &amp;killing is defo harm. Not one nor a billion people can steal the life of one innocent. https://t.co/RxBGW1ZfYJ


-896.5956483567273: @MissConception0 @MSNBC Take a good look at that pic in your tweet. Once again Trump looks like a bad boy who's been taken to the woodshed. He always looks that way after he's had a meeting with Putin. Pathetic look for a POTUS.


-897.1548884479223: I'm not American, so answer me this, how are Trump's approval figures not in single figures?

Every week even gets worse!

His ratings are this low around most of the developed world.  

How can so many American people be blind and deaf to this appalling racist, sexist charlatan?


-898.6886466138536: @sheats_david @Trump454545 trump also would have gotton that ambassador out of there long before they had the chance to hurt him. the level of their criminality in benghazi is far beyond anything any decent human being would have done


-899.8902561820609: "I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?" 

- Donald Trump, September 26, 2016 https://t.co/lLRxSW6iru


-900.7763680178622: +1  In order for Trump to be leader of free world, free world has to agree he’s our leader.

Spoiler: We don’t. He’s a Fake President & &amp; Clown-In-Chief. Joke. 

Only people who call him that are Americans, US MSM.  Please stop. The few allies you have left are already PO’d enough.


-901.9278318008345: @marklevinshow It does get tiring to have to see the Democratic liberal globalist do their therapy on air you would think they'd want to keep their Donald Trump syndrome treatment to their own self but it's painful to watch and you can't help but laugh at them


-901.989950681057: *Trump drowns a puppy, pulls it out of the water at the last moment*

Trump: "Not even Lincoln saved a puppy."

Liberals/Media: "You tried to drown it."

Hannity: "The fake news media won't even let Trump save a puppy without attacking him."

MAGA: "Why do liberals hate puppies?"


-904.2452465960267: This is what buying your own bullshit looks like when you're an asshole. Nothing will be "devastating" to Dems.

I would know, since I suffered extreme delays & &amp; horrible (lack of) care since 2008. I waited 3 years just for a brace that would allow me to get out of my wheelchair & &amp; walk, Trump signed an EO & &amp; 3 weeks later I had it........


-911.5219701320216: It's odd that people debate whether you should say something nice about Trump after he dies when no one has ever said anything nice about him while he's alive


-912.0435034276863: First, you couldn't even quote Faulkner correctly.

Second, lying to Congress/federal agents is a crime

Third, we know they wouldn't lie (while facing criminal penalties) if they weren't lying to cover up bigger crimes.

Fourth, you should hire a better attorney than Trump did.

Following the rape, Jane says Trump threatened to hurt her and her family if she ever told anyone. He suggested he could make her “disappear like Maria.” https://t.co/3bR1C0hHon


-924.5584685480246: The Trump admin is still separating families at the border, months after a "zero tolerance" policy was ended, says @ProPublica. Agents are using vague criminal allegations against parents as justification.

At least 16 new separation cases were discovered in the last 3 months. https://t.co/y02exHlIce


-924.9632590947461: @Eddie_and_Patti @Doug5007 @robreiner The House will subpoena the IRS to get Trump's tax filings, whether he's "squared away w the IRS" or not. This was never about his taxes as much as hiding potential vulnerability to political linked foreign sources. Separately, NY State WILL go after him, and he'll lose $ bigly


-926.5303584418131: Now that billionaire child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein is back in the news, it seems like a good time to take a closer look at allegations that Donald Trump raped a 13-year-old girl at Epstein's Manhattan home in 1994.

Trump is more than overdue for his #MeToo  reckoning... https://t.co/pumMTXcA3h

-939.84950792774: The Trumpers are so pavlovian in saying "no evidence of collusion" & &amp; have said it so often that they don't even know what collusion means and even if presented with evidence of coordination between Trump and other parties to do crimes of any nature they say "no collusion"


-940.949425439884: The closer Trump comes to being impeached or prosecuted or voted out of office the more desperate and dangerous he will become.  We haven't seen his worst yet.   He'll do anything to cling to power.  He'll try to destroy America if there's a win in it for him.  Or just for spite. https://t.co/S0GqEtr2t2


-941.3791568304108: "Keeping people unhealthy is a tool of oppression. The Trump admin knows this, and they have enacted many policies to take power away from women, LGBTQ communities, communities of color, people with low incomes & &amp; immigrants." 
—@PPFA President @DrLeanaWen https://t.co/HRCvFntTDq


-944.007690770879: It's not a question of if Trump committed crimes, it's a question of how many crimes he committed, how many family members and Republican allies were complicit and how much jail time will they all serve.  It's just a matter of time before Mueller exposes it all!


-947.8874842715403: I think you and I can agree, Trump is a fake president. But, IMHO, his behavior and attitudes indicate the possibility that he's a fake human as well. The callus disregard for human suffering indicates two large hollow areas, mid body & &amp; between the ears.
Diagnosis - Must impeach

Under Obama, 307,000 vets died waiting for VA care - according to CNN

Since Trump took office, he’s fired nearly 4,000 VA employees who failed to take care of our veterans

We are finally draining the swamp and holding the fourth branch of government accountable


-949.602412357971: @WalshFreedom President Trump has enacted harsher sanctions against Russia than Obama ever did.  Dip s**t Mueller has had over 2 years and what 40 45 million dollars and still can't figure anything out. He's either really pathetic at his job or there's nothing there.

-963.5360051481609: OMG 😮. I absolutely agree!!!!  He can’t read and will make it all about himself. I didn’t agree with a lot of both Bush’s policies but I do think he should be given a respectful service. Trump finds a way to ruin every event he attends. He shouldn’t even attend this funeral!

-991.1006474183843: I never believed Trump had an ounce of decency, never believed he would change as President.

-1167.5332266340788: Trump just made America look like a bunch of morons. We were the only country not to sign on to a commitment to fighting climate change at the G20. We look so stupid. Trump is making America look like the international laughingstock he is.


-1170.3868693765487: @ammamaw @StevenBeschloss I have lost faith in some who blindly supported Obummer for 8 years and still believe he did a good job.We need to find medium ground liberals hate Trump and conservatives hated Obama.Obama was terrible.Trump has done good things but you hate him so nothing he does will be good.


-1173.723728908522: The democrats are the most evil group of people you can ever imagine, including the fake media. We knew they were going to try and destroy Trump. That being said, it turns out that the republicans have been the biggest roadblock in the way of President Trump’s agenda.

Sickening.


-1174.2765768378563: He's a monster, a sick lingering evil that knows no end—it's clear when you see this clip https://t.co/GsSZHSQz62

Trump will fall hard one day soon. Evil always does. And for lack of a better expression, that day can’t come too soon.


-1177.5441985487935: Trump told the caravan several times to go home. He made it clear they're not getting in. Surely they got the word, but yet, they get here and act surprised like, "Huh, we can't get in in?!" They knew he wasn't joking, so what did they expect to happen? Proof this was organized.


-1179.3210891627787: @Str8___jenn @MickandTriangle @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I never said anything about Trump’s recent statements being valid or not. I did say that if he made an announcement about the cure for the world’s most infamous disease being found, people will hate him as if he said anything at all.


-1180.2884245107248: @ChuckCallesto It’s going 2 b a very long 2 years, especially with this idiot in charge. They won’t even attempt to run the govn’t or work to help us, the American ppl, cause they’ll b focused too much on impeaching Trump. The American ppl will regret putting them in office


-1200.2849092819565: @carolinasassie Yep! They didn’t get better deal than what had been on table from near start. They had to drag it out, try to make Trump look bad at every turn. The video at conference when Freeland presented was disgraceful. But when you see her like this in public eye, you realize #noclass. https://t.co/pTrDqFExtP


-1210.6791860313942: Hi @HowardKurtz

Why’d you let @david_bossie get away with lying by saying that @MichaelCohen212 didn’t plead guilty to anything involving @realDonaldTrump 

He pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations having to do with the 2016 Trump campaign.


-1221.2178117659805: @MeetThePress @SenJohnBarrasso keep campaigning for trump chuck todd...you and your cronies may get him elected once again.   you are so sad. @TheDemocrats , I am telling you to watch out for chuck todd, trump called him a sleepy eyed SOB and chuck is trying to get back in trump graces...trump see it.


-1311.1860444107774: @JohnathanMulroo @ben_brona19 @rreed3311 @kylerothenberg @FoxNews @laineymel @Jamierodr10 @adjunctprofessr @JanjoinedNRA @pinkk9lover @Trump454545 @ArizonaKayte @starcrosswolf @GartrellLinda @MARINE_99ZULU Because of that EO, I was able to walk (mostly) again, not to mention a decade of trying to get much needed dental surgery, because of President Trump, I finally was able to get it taken care of. No president has ever done as much as this president has done for vets.


-1393.5548196922507: @luishon2 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @brianlatham40 @HYLYDM882 @gapfiller99 @Knute45 @fairbanks_neal @jkgood1 @SirElkMN @MLeRoi @mawalk43 @Free_Media_Hub @kurltownsen @SarahWe58289080 @BarackObama @POTUS Everything Trump signs is just something else he finds a way with time profit from and out money in his own pocket. He is the biggest con man and theif this country has ever seen. It's people like you who are blind and gullible who actually believe he's helping you #Moron


-1479.7574098526375: @dphaw @DGPurser one big difference between now and when bush was in office is that trump will make sure that the dems own what they do! he will make sure everybody knows the things they are doing to try and screw up the economy,and he will veto anything they do that is real bad


-1581.8201686953803: 16/ Trump is not just guilty of election crimes; he's not just guilty of bribery; he's not just guilty of obstruction of justice and witness tampering; he's also guilty of aiding and abetting crimes against America—to wit, the computer crimes his COVERT business dealings INDUCED.


-1604.6871206923236: @Hannahj04685494 5 trump administration people have already plead guilty or been convicted lol obviously some people got there hands caught in the cookie jar! Now do I think trump will get impeached no I don’t, do I think his son might get prosecuted well not sure time will tell!
