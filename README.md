# UTSL
Unsupervised Twitter Sentiment Learner


This project was built to explore what people are thinking about certain topics, using Twitter to collect the data.

By specifying search terms in config_files/scrape_words.txt and running './run_code', you will be able to see what words people associate with your search terms, sorted by positive and negative association.

Usage:

1. Clone repo
2. open 'config_files/scrape_words.txt' and add the terms you would like to search for, one line per term
3. run './run_code'
